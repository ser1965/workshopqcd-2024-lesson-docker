## Working environment

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Note

We expect participants to work in a Unix environment on their laptop.

If you are unfamiliar with the Unix shell, you can work through the exercises in [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) tutorial by Software Carpentry. 

Windows users: the Unix tutorial give `git bash` as an option. However, for all work during the hands-on session: 
- do not use `git bash`
- do not use `Power shell` (apart from installing WSL2)
- activate WSL2 and use the Ubuntu terminal that comes with it!

### Windows

Activate [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install-wsl-command) and use the Ubuntu shell.
